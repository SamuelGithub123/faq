        title: 'What is the meaning of life?',
        answer: 'The meaning of life is a philosophical question that has been debated by scholars, theologians, and philosophers for centuries. There are many different perspectives on what the meaning of life is, and no single answer that is universally accepted. Some people believe that the meaning of life is to seek happiness, while others believe it is to fulfill a specific purpose or destiny. Some religious or spiritual beliefs hold that the meaning of life is to connect with a higher power or to reach a state of enlightenment. Ultimately, the meaning of life may be subjective and vary from person to person. Some people may find meaning in their work, while others may find it in their relationships or hobbies. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to determine their own sense of purpose and meaning in life.'

        title: 'What are the hardest programming languages?',
        answer: '1. Assembly language: Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is specific to the architecture of a particular computer system. It requires a deep understanding of computer hardware and memory management, and is generally considered to be one of the most difficult programming languages to learn. 2. Lisp: Lisp is a functional programming language that is known for its use of parentheses and its unusual syntax. It requires a different way of thinking about programming compared to more traditional imperative programming languages like Java or Python. 3. Haskell: Haskell is a functional programming language that emphasizes strong typing and lazy evaluation. It can be difficult to learn due to its abstract concepts and syntax, but it is also considered to be a very powerful and expressive language once mastered. 4. Brainfuck: Brainfuck is a deliberately esoteric programming language that is known for its minimalist syntax and difficulty. It is rarely used in practical applications, but is sometimes used as a programming challenge or as a way to teach basic programming concepts.'
